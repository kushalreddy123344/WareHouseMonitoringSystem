# WareHouseMonitoring

The Warehouse Monitoring Project is a cutting-edge solution that utilizes advanced IoT technologies to optimize warehouse operations, boost security measures, and improve overall efficiency. By tackling the common challenges faced by warehouse operators, such as inventory management and worker safety, this innovative project aims to revolutionize the way warehouses function, ultimately leading to enhanced productivity and streamlined processes.

As part of this project, a diverse range of sensors, including DHT, LDR, MQ2, load, and LED lights, are employed to gather valuable data regarding various parameters within the warehouse environment. These sensors enable the measurement of critical factors such as humidity, temperature, gas levels, weight, and lighting conditions, providing essential insights into the warehouse's operational conditions. By utilizing this sensor network, the project aims to obtain comprehensive and real-time information, enabling effective decision-making and optimization of warehouse processes.

To enhance accessibility and convenience for warehouse monitoring personnel, the collected sensor values are presented on a user-friendly web dashboard. This centralized platform provides a clear and intuitive interface, enabling the warehouse monitor to easily view and interpret the real-time data. By presenting the information in a digestible format, the web dashboard streamlines the monitoring process, empowering users to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions based on the displayed values.
